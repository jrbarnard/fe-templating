Priorities:
 - Update to bootstrap 4
 - Another page reusing carousel component
 - Another page reusing carousel component but passing into body region (standard content) - can this be done?
 - Breadcrumbs (bootstrap)
    - Need to expose current uri struct array, will need to look at overall globals and twig context
 - General layout extend for some templates (which has grid with sidebar)
 - Sidenav (siblings and other options)
 - Document how to use it properly including twig and nav examples
