Priorities:
    - couple of additional pages to show differing types of extends and template sharing / content (carousel etc? - other bootstrap stuff)
    - extension api
    - Further documentation
    - Clean up way menus are done, pre build array of menu objects with levels etc, as timber does
    - Way to inject twig vars, without having to directly reference twig?
